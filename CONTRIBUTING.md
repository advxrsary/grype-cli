## Coding conventions

Start reading the code and you'll get the hang of it. For readability you should follow these conventions:

* Indentation is a single tab (4 spaces)
* ALWAYS use spaces around operators ( = + - * / ), after commas, colons and semicolons, around { and before }
* This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.

## License

By contributing your code, you agree to license your contribution under the terms of the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file.
